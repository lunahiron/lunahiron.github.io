<p>Another topic I work on is modeling internal tides. I investigated the influence of vertical resolution on internal tide energetics and its effects on underwater acoustics propagation using HYCOM. Using HYCOM in an idealized configuration with a ridge and only forced by semidiurnal tides, I found that increasing the vertical resolution impacts vertical shear and tidal energetics (baroclinic kinetic energy and available potential), which in turn impact sound speed variability and underwater acoustic properties (Hiron et al., 2024). Ongoing research includes the interaction between internal tides and mesoscale eddies. </p>
