short-description: 'The Loop Current (LC) is the only permanent current and the most energetic feature in the Gulf of Mexico. Once the LC reaches an advanced and unstable stage, a warm eddy sheds from the main current and moves southwestward. The shedding of the LC is very irregular, and its prediction is still very inaccurate. Nonetheless, it is known that cold-core, frontal eddies play an important role in the shedding as they can amplify and constrict the LC.'

<p>The Loop Current (LC) is the only permanent current and the most energetic feature in the Gulf of Mexico. Once the LC reaches an advanced and unstable stage, a warm eddy sheds from the main current and moves southwestward. The shedding of the LC is very irregular, and its prediction is still very inaccurate. Nonetheless, it is known that cold-core, frontal eddies play an important role in the shedding as they can amplify and constrict the LC. These cold-core eddies form and grow through baroclinic instability in the LC’s vicinity. My research investigates the intensification of these frontal eddies and their interactions with the LC front and the surrounding flow. </p>

<p> Using a wide variety of datasets (mooring array, airborne CTDs, altimetry sea surface height, and submesoscale-resolving numerical model), I found that the growth of large frontal eddies can locally modify large-scale currents (the LC in this case) by intensifying eddy-current fronts at and below the surface, tilting isopycnals (~30% increase in horizontal density gradient), and bringing colder, deeper water to the surface (Hiron et al., 2020). A local increase in LC available potential energy is observed during frontal eddy growth. The intensification of these eddies also shift the balance of forces in the LC front from a geostrophic regime to a cyclostrophic regime – the centrifugal force becomes important (Hiron et al., 2021).</p> 
	
<p>Additionally, frontal eddies also shape the surrounding circulation by attracting, during formation, offshore and onshore waters, facilitating cross-shelf exchange of water mass and chlorophyll. Once formed, these eddies can trap and transport water and passive tracers within their interior from the surface down to approximately 600 m for several weeks without exchange with their surroundings – a result that agrees with satellite observations of oil transport following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion (Hiron et al., 2022).</p>
