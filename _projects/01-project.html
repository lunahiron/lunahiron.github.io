short-description: 'The Loop Current (LC) is the only permanent current and the most energetic feature in the Gulf of Mexico. Once the LC reaches an advanced and unstable stage, a warm eddy sheds from the main current and moves southwestward. The shedding of the LC is very irregular, and its prediction is still very inaccurate. Nonetheless, it is known that cold-core, frontal eddies play an important role in the shedding as they can amplify and constrict the LC.'

<p>The Loop Current (LC) is the only permanent current and the most energetic feature in the Gulf of Mexico. Once the LC reaches an advanced and unstable stage, a warm eddy sheds from the main current and moves southwestward. The shedding of the LC is very irregular, and its prediction is still very inaccurate. Nonetheless, it is known that cold-core, frontal eddies play an important role in the shedding as they can amplify and constrict the LC. These cold-core eddies form and grow through baroclinic instability (energy flow: LC &rarr; eddy) in the LCâ€™s vicinity.</p>

<p>My dissertation investigates the intensification of these frontal eddies and their interactions with the LC front and the surrounding flow. I found that further growth of these eddies can occur through linear and nonlinear eddy-front interactions associated with the extraction of mass from the surrounding flow, and can drive, locally, an inverse energy transfer (eddy &rarr; LC), and assess the shedding of the LC.</p>

The gray dots and the thick gray line are the locations of the tall moorings (Lugo-Fern&aacute;ndez, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2016) and the area where I applied an objective analysis. The black line shows the location of the cross-section. (c) and (d) shows a cross-section of the density filed and total velocity. The total velocity is represented by the white lines, dotted lines if flowing southeastward perpendicular to the cross-section, and solid lines if flowing northwestward. </span>
